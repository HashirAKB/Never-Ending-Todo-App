Let's break down the code snippet step by step to understand how it calculates the `TotalRequestCount` while excluding its own value:

### Original Code Snippet

```javascript
// Calculate TotalRequestCount without including itself
const filteredValues = Object.entries(parsedData)
.filter(([key]) => key!== 'TotalRequestCount')
.map(([_, value]) => parseInt(value, 10));

parsedData.TotalRequestCount = filteredValues.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
```

### Explanation

1. **`Object.entries(parsedData)`**: This method is used to create an array of `[key, value]` pairs from the `parsedData` object. Each element in the array is a tuple where the first item is the key and the second item is the value. For example, if `parsedData` looks like this:

   ```json
   {
     "TotalRequestCount": "30",
     "02.07.2024": "15"
   }
   ```

   Then `Object.entries(parsedData)` will produce:

   ```javascript
   [
     ["TotalRequestCount", "30"],
     ["02.07.2024", "15"]
   ]
   ```

2. **`.filter(([key]) => key!== 'TotalRequestCount')`**: This part filters out the entry corresponding to the `TotalRequestCount` key. It iterates over each `[key, value]` pair and includes only those pairs whose key is not equal to `'TotalRequestCount'`. After filtering, the array will no longer contain the `TotalRequestCount` entry.

3. **`.map(([_, value]) => parseInt(value, 10))`**: This step transforms the filtered array of `[key, value]` pairs into an array of just the values (the counts of requests). Since we're interested in the values (and not the keys), we ignore the keys (`_`) and map each `[_, value]` pair to just `value`. Additionally, `parseInt(value, 10)` converts the string representation of the number into an actual integer. This is necessary because the original data might have been read as strings, and JavaScript performs arithmetic operations on numbers, not strings.

4. **`reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0)`**: Finally, this part sums up all the values in the `filteredValues` array to calculate the total request count. `reduce` takes a callback function `(acc, val) => acc + val` that accumulates the sum (`acc`) and adds each value (`val`) to it. The second argument to `reduce`, `0`, specifies the initial value of the accumulator (`acc`).

After executing this code, `parsedData.TotalRequestCount` will hold the correct total count of requests, excluding the count associated with the `TotalRequestCount` key itself.
