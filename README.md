# My Never-Ending Todo App

## Overview

This repository documents the ongoing development of a todo application. It serves as a practical playground for learning and implementing various web development concepts, technologies, and best practices.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this project are:

1. To provide a hands-on approach to understanding new technologies
2. To showcase the evolution of a simple todo app into a more advanced application
3. To implement and experiment with various frontend, backend, database, ORM, and authentication technologies

## Project Philosophy

I believe that building a todo app is an excellent way to grasp new concepts in web development. As I learn new technologies or techniques, I incorporate them into this project, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of how different components work together in a real-world application.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains multiple iterations of the todo app, showcasing its evolution from a simple HTML implementation to more sophisticated versions. Each iteration builds upon the previous one, introducing new features, improved user experience, or enhanced backend functionality.

## Technologies

The technologies used in this project may vary as new iterations are added. You can expect to see implementations using:

- Frontend frameworks and libraries
- Backend technologies
- Databases
- ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping)
- Authentication methods
- And more as the project progresses

## Contributions

While this is primarily a personal learning project, suggestions and feedback are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have ideas for improvement or spot any bugs.
